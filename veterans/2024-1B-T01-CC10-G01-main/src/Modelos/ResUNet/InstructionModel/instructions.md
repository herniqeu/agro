# Using the Model for Image Segeneration
This tutorial will guide you through the steps to load and use a model for image segmentation tasks. We'll cover everything from setting up your environment to processing images and utilizing the model.
## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:
Python 3.6 or higher installed.
Access to Jupyter Notebook or JumbleL.
An active internet connection for downloading necessary packages.
## Download the Model
**GitHub**:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Inteli-College/2024-1B-T01-CC10-G01>
```
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
**Install Required Libraries**
Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed by running the following command in your Jupyter notebook:
```bash
!pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scipy pillow opencv-python-headless psutil
```
**Mount Google Drive (Optional)**
If you are using Google Colab or if your data is on Google Drive, mount it using:
```bash
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
## Step 2: Data Preparation
Use the ImageDataManager class to manage and process your image data. Here's how to initialize and use this class:
```bash
# Assuming the class is defined in your notebook, initialize it with the paths to your data
image_manager = ImageDataManager(base_masks_path='path_to_masks', base_inputs_path='path_to_inputs')
```
## Step 4: Using the Model for Segmentation
```bash
# Example of segmenting an image
segmented_image = model.predict(processed_data)
```
## Step 5: Visualize the Results
```bash
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Assume 'segmented_image' contains the output from the model
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(segmented_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Segmented Image')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
## Refining the Model
**Data Preparation:**
Collect new datasets for training and validation, ideally closely related to the specific application domain of the model.
Preprocess the data as required by the model, typically involving normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques.
**Fine-tuning the Model:**
Set up a training environment that reuses the pre-trained weights except for the output layer, which should be adapted to new classes if necessary.
For fine-tuning in **PyTorch**:
```python
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True  # Allow all parameters to update during training
# Replace the last layer if the number of target classes has changed
model.outc = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, num_classes, kernel_size=1)
```
For fine-tuning in **TensorFlow**:
```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
# Assume model's final layer is named 'final_conv'
model.get_layer('final_conv').trainable = True
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```
**Training:**
Configure the training parameters, such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate.
Implement a training loop or use a built-in training function provided by the framework.
Example for **PyTorch**:
```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
# Assume 'train_loader' is the DataLoader for training data
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
Example for **TensorFlow**:
```python
model.fit(train_data, epochs=num_targets, validation_data=validation_data)
```
**Evaluation and Further Optimization:**
After training, evaluate the model on a separate validation or test dataset to assess its performance.
Adjust the training parameters based on the performance metrics and repeat the training if necessary to achieve better accuracy.
## Notes
Ensure that the computational resources are adequate for training and refining the model, especially when working with large datasets and deep models like ResUNet.
